Improvement points for the api:
1) Improve image upload since it is currently done in a binary way. It could be worked as base64 or save a URL of the image in the database and upload it to the repository.
2) Perform Unit test. I didn't have time sorry.

As a final clarification, I wasn't able to run docker, I tried to do it with docker-compose but when doing step 4 it broke and I couldn't solve it. Anyway I give you the dockerfile and docker-compose file
